# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
The RMS Titanic was known as the unsinkable ship and was the largest, most luxurious passenger ship of its time. Sadly, the British ocean liner sank on April 15, 1912, killing over 1500 people while just 705 survived. In this article, we will analyze the Titanic data set and make two predictions. One prediction to see which passengers on board the ship would survive and then another prediction to see if we would’ve survived. Data Set Column Descriptions pclass: Passenger Class (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd) survived: Survival (0 = No; 1 = Yes) name: Name sex: Sex age: Age sibsp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard parch: Number of parents/children aboard fare: Passenger fare (British pound) embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton) adult_male: A male 18 or older (0 = No, 1=Yes) deck: Deck of the ship who: man (18+), woman (18+), child (&lt;18) alive: Yes, no embarked_town: Port of embarkation ( Cherbourg, Queenstown, Southampton) class: Passenger class (1st; 2nd; 3rd) alone: 1= alone, 0= not alone ( you have at least 1 sibling, spouse, parent or child on board) age Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5 sibsp The dataset defines family relations in this way: Sibling= brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister Spouse= husband, wife (mistresses and fiancés were ignored) parch The dataset defines family relations in this way: Parent= mother, father Child= daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson Some children traveled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
